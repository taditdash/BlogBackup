# Building RESTful Web services with .NET Core

After my first book on "[Dependency Injection in .NET Core 2.0](http://bit.ly/DependencyInjectionHardCopy)", I got a proposal from my mentor and guru **Mr. Gaurav Aroraa** to co-author a book with him on _RESTful Web Services with .NET Core_. \[caption id="attachment\_109" align="aligncenter" width="169"\]![Gaurav Aroraa](http://blog.taditdash.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Gaurav-Aroraa-169x300.jpeg) Gaurav Aroraa\[/caption\] The experience of writing my first book helped me immensely and persuaded me to go for the second one without any confusion. Most importantly with the legend himself, who has written 100+ books! How can I just let this opportunity slip from my hand?
