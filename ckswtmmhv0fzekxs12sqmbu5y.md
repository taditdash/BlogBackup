# Building RESTful Web services with .NET Core

After my first book on "[Dependency Injection in .NET Core 2.0](http://bit.ly/DependencyInjectionHardCopy)", I got a proposal from my mentor and guru **Mr. Gaurav Aroraa** to co-author a book with him on _RESTful Web Services with .NET Core_.

The experience of writing my first book helped me immensely and persuaded me to go for the second one without any confusion. Most importantly with the legend himself, who has written 100+ books! How can I just let this opportunity slip from my hand?

REST is an architectural style that tackles the challenges of building scalable web services. In today's connected world, APIs have taken a central role on the web. APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become synonymous with APIs.

The depth, breadth, and ease of use of ASP.NET Core make it a breeze for developers to work with for building robust web APIs. This book takes you through the design of RESTful web services and leverages the ASP.NET Core framework to implement these services. 

This book begins by introducing you to the basics of the philosophy behind REST. You'll go through the steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service.

This book takes a practical approach, that you can apply to your own circumstances. This book brings forth the power of the latest .NET Core release, working with MVC. Later, you will learn about the use of the framework to explore approaches to tackle resilience, security, and scalability concerns.

You will explore the steps to improve the performance of your applications. You'll also learn techniques to deal with security in web APIs and discover how to implement unit and integration test strategies.

By the end of the book, you will have a complete understanding of Building a client for RESTful web services, along with some scaling techniques.
