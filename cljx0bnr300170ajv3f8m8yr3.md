So, the exception completely indicates to us that it is not able to find a Key in the model, which is defined in the database for that entity.

## Problem

When you design a model class for the entity, you define many properties including keys, if any. But how MVC would know that some property is a key and some other is a normal? There should be some rule, right? Yes, there is. And if you donâ€™t follow that rule, you would definitely get the below exception.

> EntityType: EntitySet '*\[Entity Name\]*' is based on type '*\[Entity Name\]*' that has no keys defined.

## Solution

MVC will automatically recognize an entityâ€™s Key if it follows the convention â€˜Idâ€™ or â€˜EntityNameIdâ€™. Additionally, the entity must expose this as a **PROPERTY** AND it must be **PUBLIC**. If you donâ€™t follow the convention, then you need to explicitly indicate that particular property as a Key by using an annotation.

Letâ€™s explore more below.

## Example

### Convention â€˜Idâ€™ or â€˜EntityNameIdâ€™

```csharp
public int Id { get; set; }
```

OR

```csharp
public int EntityNameId { get; set; }
```

### Using \[Key\] Attribute

Just put `[Key]` on top of your property (which is presenting primary key). Something like this.

```csharp
[Key]
public int AnyName { get; set; }
```
