Recently, I have started learning AngularJS. *AngularJS* is a *JavaScript* Framework that helps you declare more HTML Tag Attributes with compelling functionality.

## Let‚Äôs Code Something

The first thing, which I tried to do, is to add two numbers and show the result in a `TextBox`. I coded like below‚Ä¶

```xml
<div ng-app="">
    <p>First Number:
        <input type="text" ng-model="a" />
    </p>
    <p>Second Number:
        <input type="text" ng-model="b" />
    </p>
    <p>Sum: {{ a + b }}</p>
</div>
```

### Couple of Notes

* The `ng-model` directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name. So, the variable `"a"` will contain first `TextBox` Value and `"b"` will contain the second `TextBox` value.
    
* **{{ expression }}** is used to dynamically bind the result of the expression. Thus, while typing on the `TextBoxes`, this place will populate with the result of the expression, which is our expected summation.
    

### Alright, Let‚Äôs See What Happened Next

The following screenshot would tell you what happened after that.

It is actually not adding, but concatenating the numbers. Why did this happen? That is because the values inside the `TextBoxes` are always a string. They are not numbers. Thus, the ‚Äú+‚Äù operator would help them concatenate.

## Looking for Solutions !!!

Now, I researched and found two solutions.

### Solution 1 ‚Äì Using Double Negation

Very beautiful hack. Code as‚Ä¶

```xml
<div ng-app="">
    <h3>Using Double Negation</h3>
 
    <p>First Number:
        <input type="text" ng-model="a" />
    </p>
    <p>Second Number:
        <input type="text" ng-model="b" />
    </p>
    <p>Sum: {{ a -- b }}</p>
</div>
```

### Solution 2 ‚Äì Using HTML5 Input Type Number

This is the most preferable way of achieving this task as it uses *HTML5* Input Type `Number`. So, when we use this `Number` Type, then the ‚Äú+‚Äù operator will work because the values are numbers by default.

```xml
<div ng-app="">
    <h3>Using Input Type Number</h3>
 
    <p>First Number:
        <input type="number" ng-model="c" />
    </p>
    <p>Second Number:
        <input type="number" ng-model="d" />
    </p>
    <p>Sum: {{ c + d }}</p>
</div>
```
