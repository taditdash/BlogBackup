Stellar Data Recovery provides an excellent and easy-to-use tool for PST repair.

## UI

I was very impressed by the look and feel as it has the same kind of theme as Outlook so it feels very homely for existing Outlook users.

## Function

The ease by which you move step by step till the end feels effortless.

There is one option to select the file directly. If you don’t know the direct location, you can provide a **“Look in”** location, where the software would help you to find all the PST files inside the folder and its subfolders.

Check how it shows you all the available PST files when you click **“Start”**.
