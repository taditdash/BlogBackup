Microsoft MVP 2014

***\[Update on 4th April\]***  
My best birthday Gift was on 4th April from my CEO [**Mr. Chinmoy Panda**](http://in.linkedin.com/in/chinmoypanda). He narrates my story in his own words. [Celebrating Awesomeness](http://www.mindfiresolutions.com/blog/2014/04/04/celebrating-awesomeness)

> Be awesome. Be Tadit.

***\[Blog Continues\]***  
Thank God, I was not fooled on April 1. 😃

I am really happy to announce that I have been awarded as one of the “**Most Valuable Professionals**” in `ASP.NET/IIS` category. This is the very first time I am getting awarded by *Microsoft* for my Technical Community Activities.

## What is Microsoft MVP?

Answer: [Click here to know more.](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx)

> The Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award is our way of saying thank you to exceptional, independent community leaders who share their passion, technical expertise, and real-world knowledge of Microsoft products with others. It is part of Microsoft’s commitment to supporting and enriching technical communities. Even before the rises of the Internet and social media, people have come together to willingly offer their ideas and best practices in technical communities.

## My Journey So Far…

My journey started on *11 July 2011*, when I joined [Mindfire Solutions](http://www.mindfiresolutions.com/). I was passionate for `.NET` Technologies during my Engineering days and fortunately I got a place in `.NET` Team after the training sessions.

I made many friends and some are indeed very special to me. They always encourage me for Community Activities and eventually, I come to know about [*Code Project*](http://www.codeproject.com/) Community. *Code Project* is an awesome place to write *Articles*, *Tips* and *Question Answer* Activities.

So, I went on answering the *Questions* first, then I gradually tried my hand at *Articles* and *Tips*. I got a very good response and votes from the viewers. The *CodeProjectians* always boost me for my work. I also started writing Blogs.

Whenever I get time, I always look at the groups on *Facebook* and try to answer their queries. *Twitter* helped me to promote my writings all over the world. Tweeting good Programming resources is something I do regularly. My Reputation Manager had enough faith in me to give me the *Moderation* work for [*Dynamics CRM Team Blog*](http://www.mscrmmindfire.wordpress.com).

The Teams I have worked for in my company have taught me many useful tricks to tackle problems on the fly. My previous `.NET` team was amazing, disciplined and always believe in a fun-filled workplace. My current *Dynamics CRM Team* has a bunch of *Geeks*, who are hard-working and always deliver work on time. These champs taught me how to have patience in everything I do.

Then a special moment came !!! **1st January 2014**, I got awarded a [**Code Project MVP**](https://taditdash.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/codeproject-mvp-status-for-2014/), which strengthened my chances for **Microsoft MVP Award**. My happiness knew no bounds. Then I worked harder than before.

Finally, on *April Fool’s Day* (*6:57 PM IST*), I got the mail from *Biplab* that I have been awarded. I was speechless !!!

## The most common question now is: How do you manage your time !!!

I am just crazy !!!

It makes you excited for the next question when somebody appreciates the solution, which you have just answered. Try sometime, you will feel better for sure. Read below to know how mad I am.

* Sleepless nights (not always, if I had comments on my answers or if somebody is waiting for my reply).
    
* Working on weekends.
    
* Answering questions while sitting in the back seat of my friend’s bike.
    
* Immensely waiting for the network on my *iPad* to come to my native place so that I can just answer one question.
    
* Publish the code while working at the office and in between the publish operation, answer one question.
    

There are many other situations, which can’t be described here !!! 😃

## I would like to dedicate this to my…

Grand Father (**Ganeswar Tripathy**). His love and blessings always take me step by step towards success. All is for you, I miss you. 😔

## I would like to thank…

## What’s Next?

As simple as that !!! Continue what I am doing and learn from my senior *MVPs* and my *MVP lead*. Contribute to online/offline events. Add some more skills to my skill set.

The journey will continue… Bless me and wish me luck.
