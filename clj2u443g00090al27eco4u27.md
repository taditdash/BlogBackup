## Introduction

We will discuss a quick tip to resolve the SourceTree issue mentioned in the title.

## Background

My system got upgraded to *Windows 8.1* and I had to install all required software for the development work. I use SourceTree as a tool for *Git* commands for projects. So, I installed that again after the format.

## Problem

Unfortunately, when I started adding the projects as working copies, it complained to me that “*This is not a valid working copy path*“. The error is not so self-explanatory, which triggered research work.

## Solution

Before I landed on the solution, I visited all available menu options in SourceTree to discover the problem. Finally, something engrossed me. I was on *Git* Tab.

`Tools -> Options -> Git`

I found some buttons saying “*Use Embedded Git*“, and “*Use System Git*” at the bottom. So, I suspected that Git is not yet enabled for SourceTree. Therefore, it is not able to identify my commands. I enabled it, that’s why it is shown as disabled below.

Voila!!! Everything started working as expected.
