Last Saturday, I had the opportunity to attend a fantastic event on Serverless on Azure, organized by Experis - A Manpower company. The event was held at *Experis, Tower C, 7th floor, IBC Knowledge Park, Bhavani Nagar, SG Palya, Bannerghatta Main Road, Bangalore 560029* and featured four speakers who shared their insights and experiences on building serverless applications on Azure. Here are some of the highlights from the event.

## My takeaways üôå

I really enjoyed attending the event and learned a lot about serverless on Azure. I also got to network with some fantastic people who share my passion for technology. I would like to thank *Experis* for organizing this event and giving me this opportunity. I would also like to congratulate the *BDotnet* User Group and specially *Swaminathan Vetri* for coordinating this event. I look forward to attending more events like this in the future.

One of the best moments of the event was when I got a signed copy of *Karthikeyan‚Äôs book ‚ÄúDevelopers Road Ahead‚Äù*. It is a great book that covers various topics related to software development and career growth. I can‚Äôt wait to read it!
