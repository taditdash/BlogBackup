# Design is a process!

![](http://taditdash.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Design-is-a-Process.jpg)

Design is a process, not a work of a genius with deep natural talents.

Today I started the Coursera course "[UX Design: From Concept to Prototype](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-concept-wireframe/home/welcome)" from my specialization "[User Experience Research and Design](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/michiganux)" from the University of Michigan.

I always thought that design is something which can be done by creative and genius people with natural talent and thinking process.

However, the instructor Predrag Klasnja has clarified my doubt and showed me new light to learn the skills. He says that design is actually a process comprising of different steps, if taken in sequence then anyone can do.

He has a very well compiled course structure and I hope I will complete everything with good grades.

That's it for today. Have a nice day. Read my other blogs [here](http://taditdash.co.in/blogs/).
