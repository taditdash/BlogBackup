## What is Microsoft MVP?

Answer: [Click here to know more.](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx)

> The Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award is our way of saying thank you to exceptional, independent community leaders who share their passion, technical expertise, and real-world knowledge of Microsoft products with others. It is part of Microsoft’s commitment to supporting and enriching technical communities. Even before the rises of the Internet and social media, people have come together to willingly offer their ideas and best practices in technical communities.

## Thanks to…

* **Biplab Paul**, and **Gandharv Rawat** for believing in me. Thank you **Siddharth Rout** for polishing my skills before the first award in 2014.
    
* Thanks to all MVPs in my network.
    
* Thanks to my friends, colleagues and leads, who always support and encourage me. Special thanks to **Debasis Behera** who pulled me to [**The Code Project (www.codeproject.com)**](http://www.codeproject.com/) for answering questions. That was my baby step towards tech community activities. **Kshirodra Meher**, **Sibasis Jena** and **Deepak Jena** and **Tapan Khatua** – these geeks help me sharpen my knowledge.
    
* My family has been a great inspiration, which propels me to hard work. Thank you, Grandfather (Mr. Ganeswar Tripathy) for guiding me. I miss you. 😔
    
* Last, but not the list, my heartiest gratitude to the members of the Microsoft Dev Community, Odisha. Without them, I am nothing.
    

Thank you almighty, Jay Jagannath!!!
